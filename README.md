The primary objective is to assess the possibility of closing one of Mint Classics’ storage facilities while maintaining effective customer service and efficient inventory management. Through the Mint Classics' database, I analyzed stock levels, customer demand, and warehouse capacity across Mint Classics’ storage facilities to determine if inventory from the proposed closure of a warehouse can be redistributed to other locations without disrupting service.
