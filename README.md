The primary objective is to assess the possibility of closing one of Mint Classics’ storage facilities while maintaining effective customer service and efficient inventory management. Through the Mint Classics' database, I analyzed stock levels, customer demand, and warehouse capacity across Mint Classics’ storage facilities to determine if inventory from the proposed closure of a warehouse can be redistributed to other locations without disrupting service.


Key Findings
1.
Customer Demand: Analysis of sales and order data indicates that Warehouse South has the least demand and closing it and redistributing its inventory would not affect customer service as much as closing any other warehouse.
2.
Space Availability: Warehouse North & South store more than one product line and have the least amount of space available. Warehouse East has the most stock but still has more space available compared to North and South. Warehouse West has the most space available. There is enough space available to redistribute stock from the closure of Warehouse South.
3.
Stock levels: There are several poor performing products with an Inventory to Sales ratio higher than 6.5.On the other hand, there are top performing inventory that needs to be restocked because of their high demand.


Recommendations
1.
Closure of Warehouse South and redistributing its inventory across the remaining warehouses.
2.
Redistributing inventory of Warehouse South according to product line so that each remaining warehouse gets to store an additional product line based on space availability.
3.
A  reduction of poor performing stock will help with redistribution of inventory and free up extra space for top selling inventory.
